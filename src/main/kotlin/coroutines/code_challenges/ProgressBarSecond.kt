// conclusions
// In the end, our code is going to display a progress-bar animation for five seconds and then stop it.
/* You can also make use of a Job extension function, called cancelAndJoin(), that combines the cancel() and join() calls together. However, if you don't want to wait for the actual coroutine stop-event, a simple cancel() call is enough.*/
